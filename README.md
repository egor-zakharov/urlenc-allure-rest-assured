# urlenc-allure-rest-assured
On one of my projects I needed to add data-urlencode parameters to cURL in the allure report.

It was before:
![Before](/screens/before.png)

It became after:
![After](/screens/after.png)

:cactus: It's not an example of tests, it's just an example of additional report parameters.

## Tools
I used next frameworks:
* [jUnit5](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5)
* [REST Assured](https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured)
* [Allure](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure-java)
